# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given a string `s`, find the length of the  **longest**   **substring**  without duplicate characters.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 0 <= s.length <= 105
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
       HashSet<Character> set = new HashSet<>();

       int maxLength=0;
       int left=0;

       for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){

        while(set.contains(s.charAt(i))){
            set.remove(s.charAt(left));
            left++;
        }

        set.add(s.charAt(i));
        maxLength=Math.max(maxLength,i-left+1);
       }

       return maxLength;


    }
}
```

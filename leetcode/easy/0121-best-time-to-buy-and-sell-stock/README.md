# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a  **single day**  to buy one stock and choosing a  **different day in the future**  to sell that stock.

Return  *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= prices.length <= 105
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 104

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        // Base case: If we don't have at least 2 prices, we can't buy and sell
        if (prices.length < 2) {
            return 0;
        }

        int minPrice = prices[0]; // Track the lowest buying price seen so far
        int maxProfit = 0;        // Track the best profit seen so far

        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            // Update minPrice if we find a cheaper day to buy
            if (prices[i] < minPrice) {
                minPrice = prices[i];
            } 
            // Calculate profit if we sell today, and update maxProfit if it's better
            else if (prices[i] - minPrice > maxProfit) {
                maxProfit = prices[i] - minPrice;
            }
        }

        return maxProfit;
    }
}
```

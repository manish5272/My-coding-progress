# First and Last in Unosrted

## Problem

Given an unsorted array  **arr[]**  of integers and a  **key**  which is present in this array. Find the  **start index** (index where the element is first found from left in the array) and  **end index** (index where the element is first found from right in the array). Return an array of length 2 with elements start index and end index.

 **Note:** If the key does not exist in the array then return -1 for both start and end index.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5], key = 5
Output: [4, 5]
Explanation: 5 appears first time at index 4 and appears last time at index 5.

```

```
Input: arr = [6, 5, 4, 3, 1, 2], key = 4
Output: [2, 2]
Explanation: 4 appears first time and last time at index 2.

```

```
Input: arr = [7, 8, 6], key = 2
Output: [-1, -1]
Explanation: Since 2 does not appear in the array, we will return -1 for both the start and end indices.

```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i], key ≤ 109

```java
class Solution {
    public ArrayList<Integer> findIndex(int[] arr, int key) {
        
        ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(2);
        
        int target = key;
        int first = -1;
        int last =-1;
        
        
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            
            if(arr[i] == target){
                
                first=i;
                break;
            }
        }
        list.add(first);
        for(int j=arr.length-1;j>=0;j--){
            if(arr[j] == target){
                last=j;
                break;
            }
            
        }
        list.add(last);
        
        return list;
        
        
    }
};
```

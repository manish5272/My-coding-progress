# Reverse Each Word in String

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given a string  **s**, you need to reverse each word in it where the words are separated by spaces and return the modified string.

 **Note:** The string may contain leading or trailing spaces, or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words, and no extra spaces should be included.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: s = " i like this program very much "
Output: "i ekil siht margorp yrev hcum"
Explanation: The words are reversed as follows:
"i" -> "i","like"->"ekil",
"this"->"siht","program" -> "margorp",
"very" -> "yrev","much" -> "hcum".
```

```
Input: s = " pqr mno "
Output: "rqp onm"
Explanation: The words are reversed as follows: "pqr" -> "rqp" and "mno" -> "onm"

```

```
Input: s = "pqr"
Output: "rqp"
Explanation: The words are reversed as follows: "pqr" -> "rqp"
```

        // Code here
        
        
        String[] arr = s.trim().split("\\s+");
        
        for(int i = 0;i<arr.length;i++){
            
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(arr[i]);
        
        arr[i] = sb.reverse().toString();
            
        }
        
        
        return String.join(" ",arr);
    }
}

```
